## 🕹️ Gameplay Experience

The project combines city-builder mechanics with narrative decision-making:

* **Leader Selection**: 4 unique profiles (The Entrepreneur, The Militant, The Union Leader, and The Influencer) with specific attributes that shape your early game.
* **Triple-Impact Management**:
    * 💵 **Budget**: The municipal treasury. No money, no public works (or campaign barbecues).
    * ❤️ **Popularity**: Your political life insurance.
    * 💼 **Corruption**: A dangerous shortcut to quick cash, but a straight line to federal intervention.
* **Dilemma Engine**: Random events (strikes, potholes, "family favors") requiring immediate decisions with systemic consequences.
* **Interactive Map**: Real-time visualization of inaugurated public works.
* **Vox Populi**: A live citizen feedback feed that reacts to your policies and charisma levels.
